# Hello! I'm Elias.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gelias/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am an intelligence and security professional with over a decade of experience in intelligence analysis, emergency management, and supporting real-time tactical law enforcement operations. My career has involved domestic and international terrorism investigations and building corporate security intelligence programs for both the public and private sectors.

My work has ranged from tracking emerging threats to developing intelligence workflows that enhance security operations. Now, I am expanding my expertise into cybersecurity, building a home lab focused on adversary simulation, detection engineering, and threat hunting.

This GitHub repository documents my hands-on projects in SIEM integration, web attack analysis, and automated security monitoring as I transition into a technical security role. Through these projects, I continuously refine my technical skills, reinforce cybersecurity fundamentals, and stay current with the latest tools and evolving threats in both offensive and defensive security.

## Objective

My transition into cybersecurity is driven by a hands-on approachâ€”learning defense best practices by attacking my defenses. By running offensive security exercises against controlled, vulnerable environments, I am building skills in threat detection, log analysis, forensic analysis, and security monitoring. As I grow, I plan to learn advanced topics such as advanced adversary emulation techniques and detection engineering.
